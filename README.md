# The Scripts

This is my personal collection of useful scripts that I've created or curated over time. These scripts are primarily designed to automate and simplify various tasks, mainly for Linux environments. While most of the scripts are written in Bash and Python, you may find scripts in other languages as well. Each script is standalone, so you can download any file and use it directly without needing to download the entire repository.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork this repository and submit pull requests if you have useful scripts to share. Contributions are always welcome!
